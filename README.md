# GameOfLife
A simple implementation of John Conways Game of Life in C++.

Currently, can run any size simulation by feeding a seed via code or giving it a source file.

The source file must be a text file with a consistent number of columns per row. A hyphen ('-') is interpreted as a dead cell, any other character is a living cell.

In the future, I'll be adding in a simple UI to select a seed file (rather than doing it via code), and to manually click cells to bring them to life or kill them off.
